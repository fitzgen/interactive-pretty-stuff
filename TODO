1. make the circles shrink as they fade out.
2. hook into web audio
   - change the circle color depending on the audio
3. other types of shapes!
4. make shapes float away and wiggle
5. do the "spray paint"
   - draw splatters around the circle
6. HARD? add dripping effect (single color)
7. instead of changing colors randomly, print the spectrum of colors. like slinkies.
